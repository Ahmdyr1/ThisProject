            Hello, a being more pleasant than <br>
            I <br>
            I am the moon of <br>
            Nov 2, 2022. <br>
            On this day <br>
            the Sun told me something<br>
            the Sun, in all its glory, <br>
            in all its magnificence said <br>
            "As I was setting, I fell <br>
            I fell moon, I fell. <br>
            I fell for a face that didn't need me <br>
            A face more luminescent than you. <br>
            Ooh moon, you should've seen it. <br>
            I wish we were not entangled in this <br>
            ever going circle <br>
            If only I could grab your hand <br>
            I would've dragged you across the skies <br>
            and made you see <br>
            A tinnie tiny human <br>
            with a heart bigger than seas, <br>
            a soul lighter than skies <br>
            a smile sweeter than love itself <br>
            and eyes, eyes brighter than you." <br>
            So I was curious, very curious <br>
            Who could be such? <br>
            I wandered across the night sky <br>
            I asked the stars <br>
            I went to the fairies <br>
            I brought the tide closer that night <br>
            No one, No one could tell me <br>
            As the last hour of the night struck <br>
            I, tired and beaten <br>
            with no glimpse of you <br>
            started my journey back.<br>
            Days turned to months, <br>
            months to years <br>
            I was forever in search of you <br>
            I had lost most hope, most light. <br>
            Time passed as I changed faces <br>
            Later, much, later <br>
            I heard someone say <br>
            “My moon, my star, my dearly beloved <br>
            I am inescapably yours” <br>
            With a thousand thoughts, I wandered that night. <br>
            Pondering over the word “inescapably”. <br>
            Who would want that?<br>
            Who even is worthy of such?<br>
            To be called the heavens?<br>
            Then I remembered what the sun had told me<br>
            “Eyes, eyes brighter than you”<br>
            I knew, I knew, I knew<br>
            But who?<br>
            I believe it was the 29th of this month<br>
            that I got my answer. <br>
            You see, I had started following the boy<br>
            Waiting, listening, thinking.<br>
            I wanted to see the moon.<br>
            It was that night when I heard<br>
            “I inescapably love you too”<br>
            It was that night I saw you, my sparkle<br>
            Yes, a face more luminescent<br>
            Yes, a heart bigger<br>
            Yes, a soul lighter<br>
            Yes, a smile sweeter<br>
            Yes, eyes brighter than me<br>
            I followed you across the skies<br>
            I followed you across hearts<br>
            Eyes, infinite on me <br>
            Mine on you<br>
            I meet you at last, my envy.<br>

            Seeing you was much<br>
            but not nearly enough<br>

            I asked the lush valleys of you<br>
            They told me of summer<br>
            I asked the silent evenings of you<br>
            They told me of winter<br>
            I asked the falling leaves of you<br>
            They told me of autumn<br>
            I asked the flowers of you<br>
            They told me of springs<br>
            I asked the stars of you<br>
            They told me of me<br>
            All and every, with an image<br>
            of you.<br>
            An image distant yet mesmerizing<br>
            I wanted to hear of you<br>
            So,<br>
            I asked the boy of you<br>
            He smiled, smiled with eyes bright,<br>
            smiled and said<br>

            یہ جسے چاند کہتے ہیں، میں اسے آئینہ کہتا ہوں<br>
            ہر چمکتی چیز         کو میں اُس جیسا کہتا ہوں<br>

            I, confused and bewildered<br>
            asked again of you,<br>
            of your name.<br>
            He said<br>
            
            <br>
            <br>
            
            جسے آتا ہے مسکرانا، بہلانا، سہلانا<br>
            مجھے وسوسوں سے بچانا، پہلو میں سلانا <br>
            جس کی آنکھوں میں میرا آسمان ہے <br>
            جس کا نام میری جان یا چلو ایمان ہے<br>
            
            Iman. <br>
            Tell me more I said<br>
            Tell me of her<br>
            Cunnigly he said<br>

            <br>اب کہ کیا کریں ہم ذکرِ مہتاب سرِ مہتاب 
            <br>بس اتنا سمجھ لیجئے وہ شخص نہیں آپ سا 

            <br>Envious and envious I was <br>
            Fading to listen more.<br>
            I asked, are you grateful?<br>

            <br>چشمِ نم ہماری کو یہ گلہ ہے مجھ سے 
            <br>وہ ساتھ ہو تو ہماری ضرورت نہیں رہتی 

            <br>So, is she your muse? <br>

            <br>یہ جان لو آج کہ تیرے دم سے ایمان 
            <br>کارواں غزل کا اک صحرا سے گزرا

            What's the first thing she inspired? <br>

            He started to read a poem. <br>

            A poem I cannot understand. <br>

            “چھوٹی کی بڑی عید” 
            <br>

            I felt unjust <br>
            not to ask him of him. <br>
            I asked him 
            "When were you born?<br>
            He said<br>
            Ask me of her.<br>
            I insisted and he said<br>
            "23 May, 2022" <br>
            Curiouser and Curiouser<br>
            When did you gain consciousness then?<br>
            "8 June, 2023"<br>
            What is the most regretful day of your life?<br>
            "If I could I would go back to 23 Feb, 2024 <br> 
            and tear out my tongue.<br>
            Impale my heart with iron<br>
            Poke my eyes with wood"<br>
            But why?<br>
            "So I would be free of the regret <br>
            I face from the next day.<br>
            If I could I would fall on my knees<br>
            beg till my tongue gives out<br>
            I wish to forget that day."<br>
            I didn't ask, he didn't mention.<br>
            For days I came and listened about you<br>
            I would wait, in the sky high<br>
            wait for him to come<br>
            but then one day<br>
            No one came<br>
            There were no poems,<br>
            no tea cups,<br>
            no poet or poetry<br>
            So I waited, waited<br>
            and waited.<br>
